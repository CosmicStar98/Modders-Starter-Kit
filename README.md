# Modder's Starter Kit
~~A large collection of good 1.18.1 forge mods and resource packs i found on curse. (also a few datapacks from planetminecraft and vanillatweaks for good measure ðŸ˜Ž)
This kit includes roughly 170 mods, 34 resource packs, 25 datapacks and a pre-made keybind/server list config~~

# *"Cuz why waste time doing it yourself when somebody else has done it for you??"*

~~(Check the releases page for downloads. I do this to bypass the file size limit)~~
Taken down due to the realization that mod licenses exist. thus making the publicity of my personal modpack damn near impossible bc im not gonna spend like a million years making a mod list for curse or technic!!
sorry guys ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜”
